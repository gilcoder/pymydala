# Overview

Pymydala is a implementation of the Emotional Game Engine Gamydala. See [Brokens - Gamydala](http://www.joostbroekens.com/gamygdala) for original documentation, and papers.

# Install
This is a piece of code that you must invoke in your game code to implement characters with emotions. I implements the emotional engine [Gamydala] (http://www.joostbroekens.com/gamygdala) and my implementation is a port of the original JavaScript code available in the (Broekens) repository [https://github.com/broekens/gamygdala ].

# Documentation
We kept the code comments of the original repository, adapting it to Python notation. For now, it is not my intention to write a tutorial on how to use this piece of code. I hope the code comments and examples are useful, but I don't promise to support it. However, I will try to resolve issues that arise while I am interested in this repository.

# Important Note: We do not do technical support, nor consulting and don't answer personal questions per email.
